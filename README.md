# Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-Agent-for-the-Game-of-HEX
MONTE Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a method for finding optimal decisions in a given domain by
taking random samples in the decision space and building a search tree according to the results.
It has already had a profound impact on Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for domains that
can be represented as trees of sequential decisions, particularly games and planning problems. 
In this project I used different simulation strategies to enhance the agent policy to explore the environment.


# Requirements
1- OS: Anything | although I just used windows and ubuntu

2- tkinter

for faster simulations I recommend linux

# How to run it?

you can run the game using this command `python main.py` in the same directory

# Any good resource for MCTS algorithm?

This one is highly recommended:
